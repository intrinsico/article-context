  abstract = {Interlinking text documents with Linked Open Data enables the Web
	of Data to be used as background knowledge within document-oriented
	applications such as search and faceted browsing. As a step towards
	interconnecting the Web of Documents with the Web of Data, we developed
	DBpedia Spotlight, a system for automatically annotating text documents
	with DBpedia URIs. DBpedia Spotlight allows users to configure the
	annotations to their specific needs through the DBpedia Ontology
	and quality measures such as prominence, topical pertinence, contextual
	ambiguity and disambiguation confidence. We compare our approach
	with the state of the art in disambiguation, and evaluate our results
	in light of three baselines and six publicly available annotation
	systems, demonstrating the competitiveness of our system. DBpedia
	Spotlight is shared as open source and deployed as a Web Service
	freely available for public use.},
